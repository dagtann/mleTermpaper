This repo documents my replication of Frantz, Erica & Andrea Kendall-Taylor
(2014): A dictator's toolkit: Understanding how co-optation affects
repression in autocracies, in: Journal of Peace Research, Vol. 51(3), 
pp. 332-346. To follow my work get the data [here](http://jpr.sagepub.com/content/51/3/332/suppl/DC1). Additionally, 
you will need the [Civil Liberties Dataset](http://ps.au.dk/en/research/research-projects/dedere/datasets/). Finally, Erica Frantz was so kind to share her raw data with me. I'll post the entire required data on [http://dataverse.org/](http://dataverse.org/) as soon as I got her permission to do so.
